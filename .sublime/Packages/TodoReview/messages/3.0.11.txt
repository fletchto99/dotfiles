Also, as a side note, my good friend Adam Damiano is making a pretty interesting
game called Bot Land live over at twitch.tv/adam13531 - this isn't an
advertisement or anything, I just genuinely enjoy watching the project progress
and thought I would share it with you all.

It has been a long while since I created this project, I was just looking over
the code base with fond memories. Thank you if you have been using this plugin
over the years, it's really neat to see consistent downloads even years later.
